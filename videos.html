Gibson describes the experience of seeing a portion of a reconstructed Babbage machine in London. They discuss the details of the process of writing and planning. They discuss the relationship of the reader to the text in Difference Engine. Asked if it is easier “to invent the future or reinvent the past,” Sterling found it more difficult, Gibson found it easier. They discuss the historical language they researched and used. They reused characters from Disraeli’s novels, but some characters are based on real people, like Mori Arinori. Gibson discusses Virtual Light and talks about his movie projects. He is interested in Hollywood culture, “which is as close to my imagined future than anything else I have ever seen.” On the next tape they say that they took their instruments for scanning the future and pointed them at the past instead. The cyberpunk label, Sterling says, was applied by journalists, and he was worried that the label would mean that what they were doing was dead. The interviewer asks where they see “science fiction going.” Gibson says “there’s a bit more room now” for “people to do the oddball, off-the-wall stuff that I enjoy.” Sterling says he “read a lot of trash sci-fi when I was a kid. Sterling discusses Babbage and his history. They think they started talking about Babbage in 1983. They kept urging each other to write the book, but finally realized “it was a job” for two people. “I don’t think we could have done this without word processors,” says Sterling, who explains how they sent floppy disks back and forth. The interviewer asks if they are comfortable with the cyberpunk label, and Sterling says it does not slow them down. Asked why neither “has felt the urge” to write a “realistic article,” Gibson says he would have to use the popular “toolkit,” and he is not comfortable with that, and Sterling says his next book will be nonfiction (The Hacker Crackdown). Asked what science fiction writers they read, Gibson answers Burroughs, Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, and James Branch Cabell. They point out that they did not use the usual fictional devices, such as a conventional plot, in Difference Engine. They have “no immediate plans” to work together again; there will be no sequel to Difference Engine. They discuss sequels in science fiction, and digital sharecropping, and their friendship. They talk about their audience. Asked where the term “cyberpunk” came from, Sterling says that writer Bruce Bethke wrote a story called “Cyberpunk,” but Gardner Dozois popularized the term.

This tape is a continuation of Eddie Becker's visit to the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, followed by footage of a man attending a Masons convention, and interviews with author Bruce Sterling and Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Perry Barlow.      00:00 Black screen.      00:13 Inside the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, where money is printed. Manager says that there is no secret to the ink since it was declassified.      06:09 Manager explains the security and close tracking of the factory. Mary Brown inspects the printed money to look for defects. The cameraman asks various workers about their tasks.      28:58 Woman goes over the printing, drying, examining, and processing of money. She says the Federal Reserve tells the Bureau of Engraving and Printing how much to print.      32:33 Ron Weese talks about the money factory, saying he was amazed by the amount of money. He is in Washington for a Masonic conference and explains some of the symbols on the dollar bill. He dispels the myth that the Masons are a secret society.      38:30 Michael Bruce Sterling talks about marijuana. He talks about “hippies with computers,” people who are excited about the freedoms possible with the electronic landscape. “Hippies have been pushed off the cultural landscape.” He talks about the Craig Neidorf / Bell-South case, in which the hacker was jailed for distributing a classified document online. “We may see the ’90s as a digital ’60s…. This is a happening scene, baby.” He sees the computer underground as the new bohemia, the members of which are guinea pigs for introducing elements to society. He calls the hacker community “the first real cross-breeding of bohemia with really high technology.”      48:04 John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, talks about censorship and property rights in a new era. He compares electronic property rights to physical property rights, highlighting the difference between horse theft and the current possibility of “theft” that copies, replicates, and maybe even increases the value of the “stolen” property. He mentions the Grateful Dead’s philosophy of sharing music. He says that there are already people out on the frontier and that many in the underground claim technology and progression as their own. He says there is no moral stigma in pirating information and that this will result in a struggle in which “a lot of lawyers will make a lot of more for a long time.” He says officials, not understanding the nature of cyberspace, investigate piracy as though they were investigating witchcraft. He says the goal of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is to make sure freedoms are protected in digital media. He says that every time there is a new medium developed, the government tries to erect more extensive regulations, mentioning radio and television. He also talks about the Bell-South case describing the document as a hacker’s trophy of seven pages in “bureaucratese.”      1:00:59 End of tape."</td><td>"1991.01.Interview.onHackers.GRFG-J3NgFU"</td></tr>

Sinda Gregory also takes part. They discuss artificial intelligence, and Sterling brings up the work of Rudy Rucker and the idea of “postmodern science.” Sterling says of Gibson, “His brain works in mysterious fashion. Gibson’s “perceptions are very acute,” not like other science-fiction writers, who “are very interiorized.” They discuss Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. Sterling uses “pomo” for “postmodernism.” They talk about Difference Engine characters and the real Sam Houston. McCaffery asks about the character John Keats. They discuss the place of the book Sybil or the Two Nations, in their book. Sterling says Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher are parodied in the book. Jim joins the interviewers. Sterling says the narrator is an extremely advanced artificial intelligence from 1991, getting closer to being able to see itself. “This book is about the conceptual roots of the information revolution” where the computer becomes self aware at the end of the book.” About the process, Sterling says, “I think it’s a very seriously computer constructed book. McCaffery talks about sampling and Sterling discusses détournement. The second tape begins with Sterling telling a story about Langston Hughes and Arthur Koestler. In the book, Sterling says what looks like chaos theory was “more of a metaphorical thing” than scientific. Sterling says he began his career doing historical fantasy. McCaffery says that the book has the “underworld, outsider perspective” of the cyberpunk genre. Sterling replies that “Angel of Goliad” was an earlier draft. “We started with Sybil,” he says. Sterling says there are those who can see “that this is some kind of experimentalist narrative,” and those who ask “Where’s the plot?” “Why was it set specifically in 1855?” McCaffery asks, and what about 1907? The dates, Sterling says, were to establish “the sense of historical scope” and ability to move back and forth in history. 30 years into a computer revolution is “where we are right now.”      Collection: Larry McCaffery Papers      Rights: Copyrighted.

A high tech presentation highlighting issues such as encryption, electronic invasions of privacy, fraud, civil liberties and computer crime, preceded a panel discussion.            For the demonstration, a world-class team of four engineers from Sun and the San Diego Supercomputer Center brought in an HDTV, an ATM switch, an ISDN switch, a Russian satellite dish, a XEROX Liveboard, a BARCO projector with special video equipment, four Sparcstation 10s, a few Sparcstation 2s, and miscellaneous other equipment.            The purpose of the demonstration was to show that while our current public policy makes distinctions based on industry, those distinctions have no meaning in the underlying technology. A television is a computer and a computer is a television  a computer is a telephone and vice versa. To demonstrate the latter point, Gage and his associates showed how a new AT&T cellular phone could be changed by any 13-year old into a scanner. The demonstration also showed how DES code could be pulled off anonymous FTP systems in Finland, yet US industry was unable to export this technology.            The panel consisted of Raymond Kammer, Acting Director of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), who provided testimony on technology standard setting issues including the government-endorsed ''Clipper Chip'' encryption technology"</td><td>"1993.05.senateHearings"</td></tr>

It profiles computer hacker Kevin Mitnick who was imprisoned without bail for nearly five years.            Winner of the ''Audience Award for Documentaries'' at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, 2002            ===            FREE KEVIN            The Story They Wouldn't Tell You            Around the world, computer hackers are being portrayed as the newest brand of terrorists. This is a story of a hacker named Kevin Mitnick, imprisoned without bail for nearly five years. Freedom Downtime tries to uncover the reasons why the authorities are so scared of Mitnick as well as define what exactly he did. Surprisingly, no real evidence is ever presented by t he authorities to back up the sensationalist claims in mass media. But when a Hollywood studio decides to make a movie about Mitnick's life through the eyes of one of his accusers, hackers turn to activism to get their message out. Through interviews with relatives, friends, lawyers, and experts in the computer and civil liberties arena, a picture of a great injustice becomes apparent. A cross-country journey uncovers some realities of the hacker culture as well as the sobering fact that so many technically young adept people are being imprisoned.            This is the 2004 release, containing more footage than the original cut in 2001. Also included is an interview with Kevin.

BUT I discussed this with Charles, and he pointed out the the Rabbit character in the book is just that subset of the AI that is used to deal with humans, being part of a far larger and incomprehensible to us super-intelligence that has its own concerns. In light of that, I can now see how the Rabbit could be that AI-subset that it uses to accomplish its own agenda via manipulation of the humans – ’cause, you know, an AI needs some feet on that ground at some stage I guess."</td><td>"2004.06.LongNowF.AIquote"</td></tr>

Science fiction writer Bruce Sterling imagines how physical objects will be part of the internet as they become trackable in space and time. Bruce discusses the theoretical and technical challenges that we face as we try and think about and develop the Internet of Things. From Spimes to Thing Links to Blogjects, the terminology and verbal framing devices currently being used are pulled apart in this keynote address from the 2006 Oreilly Emerging Technology Conference. Sterling discusses at length how language shapes our understanding of technology. Phrases like Artificial Intelligence, he claims, have become frozen in time. This freezing of the language may have hindered the development of computers that have little to do with thinking and everything to do with linking, ranking and sorting. He advocates for a clash of sensibilites when coming up with proper terminology for remote technical eventualites. The Internet of Things may take up to thirty years to come about, so there is no reason to expect the terminology of today to fully describe realities of the future.    Much of the talk deals with the concept of using verbal framing devices to manifest an idea. Bruce introduces us to the idea of a spime, objects that are trackable in space and time. Spimes are material instantiations of an immaterial system, digitally manufactured things from virtual plans. The Internet of Things will change how we interact with objects from the moment of invention to the moment of decay. Bruce brilliantly fits these and other concepts within the intellectual millieu of the web 2.0 world."</td><td>"2006.03.ETECH06.IoT.fullaudio.SanDiego"</td></tr>

Google Tech Talks April 30, 2007 ABSTRACT World-renowned Science Fiction writer and futurist Bruce Sterling will outline his ideas for SPIMES, a form of ubiquitous computing that gives smarts and 'searchabiliity' to even the most mundane of physical products. Imagine losing your car keys and being able to search for them with Google Earth. This same paradigm will find you ''''wrangling'''' with product-lifecycle- management systems that do for physical objects what the iPod has done for music. These and other radical ideas are delivered in Sterling's latest book`Shaping Things'. This concise book was written to inspire designers to visualize radical scenarios connecting information technology and sustainability in a new ecology of artifacts. Sterling suggests new connections between the virtual world and the physical world that will have you rethinking many of your assumptions about how we relate to products. He will be joined by Scott Klinker, 3-D Designer-in-Residence at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, MI who leads a graduate design program known for giving form to experimental cultural ideas. Klinker's own design work focuses on digital customization as industry shifts from mass production toward niche production in a networked society. The presentation will include an invitation for Sterlling and Klinker/ Cranbrook to team-up with Google to create a short documentary film that would portray a speculative future of life with SPIMES. Distributed online, this short film would convey the look and feel of SPIME scenarios as a provocation for widespread industry discussion about the new potentials of ubiquitous, ambient, searchable, geolocative products.

I’ve been a fan of his since coming across Heavy Weather in the mid-1990’s. Climate change was not cool back then. We’re so much older than that now and the planet is so much warmer.      I was delighted, and honored, when I ran into him earlier today at the FiRE Conference in San Diego and he agreed to be interviewed for Professionally Speaking.      I really had no idea what he’d talk about. The last thing I expected was a discussion on the Mafiosi-like features of the European Union bureaucracy in Brussels. In fact he’s planning to set his next book in Europe.

Jamisna Tesanovic - a feminist writer and activist - talks about her experience on Blog B92 and how serbian society is reacting to the practice of blogging which came only more than a year ago. It started as the only non controlled media in the postwar almost lawless society...soon to become the most read and most dangerous public place for the same reasons.Filmed by the Télévision Suisse Romande at the 2008 Lift conference.

The conference on ''visualization of information'', organized by digital creative agency Scholz & Volkmer, is dedicated to new approaches that are being developed in the fields of design, art, architecture, new technologies and economy to confront today's complexity and to transform the immense flood of information into useable knowledge. We annually invite speakers - a broad mix of approaches, ways of thinking, industries and cultures - to present their most recent ideas on how to deal with the current flood of information, on how to visualize it and turn it into something that can be experienced.   When is the visualization better than the thing? Under this headline American science fiction author Bruce Sterling questioned whether we still need physical objects at all, and whether visualizations or virtual objects might start giving us the same physical effects than real things. Sterling has been one of the founders of the 80's cyberpunk movement in science fiction, best known for his work on the ''Mirrorshades anthology''. He has been the instigator of various political and ecological projects such as the Dead Media Project - a collection of ''research notes'' on dead media technologies, the Viridian Design Movement - his attempt to create a ''green'' design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecological sound design, or ''Embrace the Decay'' - an art piece commissioned by the LA Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003. Sterling has written for many magazines, including Newsweek, Fortune, or Wired, where he has been a contributing writer since its conception. He has appeared in shows like ABC's Nightline, BBS's The Late Show, CBC's Morningside, or on MTV.

The enclave maintains no diplomatic relationship with the surrounding so-called «Republic of Austria» or with the Fortress «European Union».

It’s a lack of respect due to a morally corrupted and perhaps even non-existing unity of the peoples. The goal of a glorious future is almost unreachable.

Bruce Sterling spoke about computer security, post modernity, time, the digital frontier, the nature of the archive. Sterling attempts in his lecture to get away from words in order to focus on an atemporal sensibility in order to get the audience to see images in the way he sees them.  Using a different approach to a human standpoint of time, Bruce Sterling attempts to examine futurity, history and the present from the standpoint of contemporary temporalism. Looking at the archive and our relationship to objects from Leonardo Da Vinci to contemporary fetishes, Bruce Sterling examines each subject from the standpoint of atemporality. Public open lecture for the students and faculty of the European Graduate School EGS Media and Communication Studies department program Saas-Fee Switzerland. Bruce Sterling. 2009 As well as being a leading science fiction writer, Bruce Sterling has been involved with numerous projects and written several books of futurist theory. He was the founder of the Dead Media Project, an on-line reliquary, or archive, to forgotten, or dead, media technologies.  In this way, he looked to the past through the future, anticipating, almost, in the shininess of new media, its utter destruction.  Bruce Sterling also founded the Viridian Design Movement, an environmental aesthetic movement founded on the ideas of global citizenship, environmental design and techno-progressiveness. Bruce Sterling numerous book length essays both question and promote how the future is shaping our concepts of self, time and space. In Shaping Things (2005) offer a history of shaped objects, moving from the most rudimentary hand-made artifacts through to the complex machinery which defines our current existence. In Tomorrow Now Envisioning the Next Fifty Years (2002), Sterling examines how todays technologies will affect our future lives.  Written in a wry, intelligent style, Sterlings book makes bold claims on the future, examining scientists use of medicine to extend our lives while examining at the same time our seemingless bottomless thirst for oil. Sterlings most acclaimed book, The Hacker Crackdown Law and Order on the Electronic Frontier (1993) is a deep history of the birth of cyberspace, following the periphery of the development of technology from the first telephone hackers to the governments attack on several prominent hackers in 1990. Bruce Sterlings novels include Intuition Ocean (1977), The Artificial Kid (1980), Heavy Weather (1994), Zeitgeist (2000), and most recently The Caryatids (2009). His essay collection and non-fiction books include The Hacker Crackdown Law and Order on the Electronic Frontier (1993), Tomorrow Now Envisioning the Next Fifty Years (2002), and Shaping Things (2005).

Each autonomous robot makes the decision to take the photos of particular people, while ignoring other humans in the exhibition, based on things like whether or not the viewers are smiling or the shape of their smile. When the robots identify a person or group they automatically adjust their focus and the robots stop and use a series of bright flashes to record that moment.  Surveillance technologies straddle a delicate balance we have in contemporary culture, where we are all photographed without our knowledge by cell phones, hidden cameras and sometimes ''celebritized''. For me this is a kind of modern baptism with the camera flash and the spectacle of being the focus of the camera becoming a kind of techno anointing.   In the photo that accompanies this work you will notice the Paparazzi Bot has captured Science Fiction writer Bruce Sterling at the Transmediale Exhibition where these works were invited by curator Honor Harger in 2010.

The initial news stories simply reported that the Secret Service had raided a suspected ring of hackers. Gradually, the true story emerged.      ''More than three years later, a federal court awarded damages and attorneys' fees to the game company, ruling that the raid had been careless, illegal, and completely unjustified.

Historical Narrative, Futurism and Emergent Network Culture. 2010 http://www.egs.edu/ Bruce Sterling, noted critic, science fiction writer and net theorist, lecturing on historical narrative, futurism and the emergent network culture. In this lecture Bruce Sterling discusses the (r)evolution of historical narrative in the context of contemporary and evolving network culture. He ponders the trans-temporal and trans-cultural effects of network culture in relation to cultural signifiers and rhizomatic subversions of postmodern culture, focusing on the collapse of historical narrative embedded in a disintegrating digital culture. He brings to light a philosophy of history that is evolving towards an atemporal condition of the emergent net culture, relegated to a dissipation of time-bound origins and identities. Citing the likes of Slavoj Zizek, William Gibson, and Arthur Kroker, Bruce Sterling invites us to re-shift a framework in understanding the nature of history, preempting a retrospective futurism, one that begs for accountability, consequences and a future history in the context of its rapidly evolving fragmented, hyper-linked, cross-referenced and anecdotal systems of history. Public open lecture for the students and faculty of the European Graduate School EGS Media and Communication Studies department program Saas-Fee Switzerland Europe. June 2010. Bruce Sterling.  Bruce Sterling is an Austin-born (April 14th 1954) science fiction writer and Net critic, internationally recognized as a cyberspace theorist who is also still based there. However, as a child he also spent a lot of time in India, which can partly explain why today still Sterling is fond of Bollywood movies. Sterling studied journalism. He published his first book, Involution Ocean, in 1977. However, he first started becoming famous in Austin by organizing every year a Christmas party where he would present digital art. In the 80s Sterling published Cheap Truth a series of fanzines, which are magazines for fans of a particular performer, group, or form of entertainment. He did so under the surprising but revealing pen name of Vincent Omniaveritas. In latin, ''''vincit omnia veritas'''' means ''''truth conquers all things''''. Sterling's writings have been very influential in the cyberpunk movement in literature, specifically the novels Heavy Weather (1994),Islands in the Net (1988), Schismatrix (1985), The Artificial Kid (1980). In 2003 Bruce Sterling became Professor of Internet studies and science fiction at the at the European Graduate School where he teaches intensive Summer seminars. In 2005 he became ''''visionary in residence'''' at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. Sterling lived for several years in Serbia with Jasmina Tesanovic his second wife, a Serbian author and film-maker. In September 2007 he moved to Italy where he found a peaceful place to live in Turin. Sterling has travelled the world giving many speeches and collecting awards too. For example, the Campbell Award in 1989 for his novel Islands in the Net, the Hugo Award both in 1997 and 1999 for his novelettes Bicycle Repairman andTaklamakan respectively, the Hayakawa Award in 1999 also for Taklamakan, as well as the Clarke Award in 2000 for his novel Distraction.

Or rather, have you ever truly pondered the existence of ''invisible forces'' that overlay and influence our every day reality? Well, you are not alone. For time immemorial, humanity has strived to have an intimate relationship with this alternate experiential reality.   As most of us are aware, this is a pivotal point in human evolution and technology. We can now access this world directly, through augmented reality. We are able to co-create within this realm. We can design in harmony with our divinity.   Introducing, enlitenAR, the world's first augmented spiritual reality experience. Drawing diverse esoteric knowledge from various religious practices and exercises, enlitenAR offers connections, growth and enrichment. Utilizing visual, audial and other sensory augments, all who enter are immediately touched.   Binaural beats, biofeedback, mandalas, and sacred geometry contemplations are only a fraction of the elements encountered along your digitally enhanced path. Utilizing scientific brainwave entrainment with mystic wisdom, your desired state of consciousness is only a moment away.   We know the time has come to re-religion. Now is the time to update our software. Open source aggregate spiritual knowledge will allow humanity to expand collective consciousness to new depths, rooted in common parallel spiritual systems. This is the guiding force of enlitenAR.   It's a wonderful time to be alive  and enlitenAR welcomes you with the embrace of universal love.    ** Most importantly, we must emphasize that there is only so much we can say with words. True understanding, is gathered through experience and is in return unique to each individual.   __   Film Credits:   CAST  Ryan D'Orazi  Jennifer Rosetto  Bruce Sterling  Jasmina Tesanovik  SPECIAL THANKS  Bruce Sterling, Guillame Wolf, Nick Hafermaas, Aaron Gladys, Art Center College of Design, Layar, Hoppala, Matt Cunningham, Steven Khoo, and all who helped make this dream a reality.

What can the role be for design when the reality that faces us is more extraordinary than the worlds we have imagined in science fiction? Design and Existential Risk is a series of conversations with leading thinkers, designers, authors and educators, critically questioning how the practice of design can imagine and prepare for extreme existential risks. Each event will explore the ways design thinking engages sustainability and indeed our very survival across near term [5 years], mid term [20 years] through very, very long term [tens of thousands of years and longer] time frames.

Falsch: Das Netz integriert sich in die physische Welt. Mittels Augmented-Reality-Anwendungen ist es möglich, unsere Welt mit Informationen aus dem Internet anzureichern. Die Wirklichkeit erhält so eine zweite Ebene aus Informationen. Moderne Mobiltelefonen, ausgerüstet mit GPS, Kamera, Kompass und einem Augmented-Reality-Browser, sehen wo wir uns aufhalten und zeigen uns dazu passende Informationen an, beispielsweise die Geschichte eines Denkmals. Aber auch Angaben zu Personen aus sozialen Netzwerken oder Werbung lassen sich einblenden.      Noch müssen wir uns dazu unser Telefon vor die Nase halten, doch in Zukunft könnten diese so genannten AR-Anwendungen auch in einer speziellen Brille laufen. Digitale und reale Informationen würden dann in unserem Sichtfeld zu einer Einheit verschmelzen. Schon prophezeien Experten, AR könnte die Art und Weise, wie wir uns in und über die Welt bewegen, grundlegend verändern. Denn schließlich beeinflusst das was wir sehen und über die Welt wissen, maßgeblich unser Verhalten.      In eigener Sache: Das war der vorerst letzte Elektrische Reporter in Form eines 10-minütigen Magazins. Es wird in jedem Falle weiter gehen mit der Berichterstattung aus Digitalien, in welcher Form genau, das skizzieren und beratschlagen wir gerade.

Nowadays half the world's population is on the World Wide Web, and people have begun the speak of the ''''Legacy Internet'''' as an old-fashioned business.    The novelty of the Internet as an art platform has gone away. New net-based institutions have sprung up: crowdsourcing, Processing software, Arduino controller boards, fabricators, and a maker-culture that shares its algorithms.  Mobile art apps have appeared on handheld devices, as well as augmented-reality art forms that are digital but don't work on the Internet.

Climate change, synthetic biology, mass urbanization – ‘We were here’ echoes all over. Although many people have tried to improve our relationship with nature, only few have asked the elementary question ‘what is nature?’.      This book will radically shift your notion of nature. It shows how our image of nature as static, balanced and harmonic is naive and up for reconsideration. Where technology and nature are traditionally seen as opposed, they now appear to merge or even trade places.      We must no longer see ourselves as the anti-natural species that merely threatens and eliminates nature, but rather as catalysts of evolution. With our urge to design our environment, we cause the rising of a next nature that is unpredictable as ever: wild software, genetic surprises, autonomous machinery and splendidly beautiful black flowers.

The Antwerp-based duo has developed a multidisciplinary practice that frequently collaborates with a vast network of specialists. This collaborative approach leads to the development of products and projects that are interested in gradually revealing their complexity to the user/participant over time.   'KIOSK' explores a near future scenario in which digital fabrication is so ubiquitous that we see it appear on our street corners. With KIOSK the user can 'appropriate, sample, remix, improve, up/downscale or copy new objects and 3D-print them on the spot.' KIOSK operates as a portable 3D copyshop capable of producing a 'custom made fix for your broken shoe, materialise an illegal download of Starck's Juicy Salif orange squeezer that you modified for better performance or quickly print out a present for your sister's birthday.' For The Machine Unfold, in collaboration with Indianen, created a new creative digital copy station.   A project commissioned by Z33, House for contemporary art and MU Eindhoven. With the support of Bits from Bytes and Jo Van Bostraeten. Inspired by Bruce Sterling's science fiction short story Kiosk. A collaboration with Indianen.  Kiosk is part of the exhibition The Machine - Designing a New Industrial Revolution in C-mine Genk (BE) from June 2 to October 7 2012. the-machine.be "</td><td>"2012.05.Kiosk.43664926"</td></tr>

La prima volta in edicola, a San Francisco, è invece datata 1993. Per festeggiare la ricorrenza, Wired Italia è in edicola da oggi con cinque diverse copertine. 20 anni che sono come tre secoli della storia precedente.      So parlare italiano, ma quando lo faccio la gente ride, esordisce Sterling. Mio papà era in ingegnere e avevo un beckground tecnico. Avevamo invitato anche Casaleggio, ma rispose Forse. Non è molto conosciuto negli States, ma doveva essere il fondatore di Wired. Quando abbiamo iniziato c'erano anche le donne, eh, mica solo uomini.      Proprio il primo numero di Wired, quello del maggio 1993, lo puoi trovare da oggi su App Store, gratis anche per non abbonati all'interno dell'app di Wired Italia."</td><td>"2013.05.SterlingIncontraCasaleggioIlVideo"</td></tr>

Lo abbiamo incontrato all’Internet Festival 2013 durante il suo keynote su “I nuovi linguaggi del marketing”.   “Il futuro è una forma di storia che non è ancora successa” secondo Sterling “e non si può veramente cambiare il passato, entrambi però si collegano a quello che facciamo oggi. Se potessimo confrontarci con Cavour – che era un tecno-progressista e un modernizzatore – gli chiederemmo di ferrovie, di finanza, ecc. In Piemonte, dove vivo, c’è una enorme eco del suo lavoro e lì oggi puoi parlare con tutti di broad band e alta velocità, così come allora parlavano della ferrovia”.   E lo scrittore di fantascienza americano ci racconta ben altro e ci dice che “il Web 2.0 è praticamente morto in America, ma ancora molto vivo in Italia, con tutti i suoi valori di connettività orizzontale. La sfida per il Web è la sopravvivenza, all’ombra di nuovi oligopoli verticali americani come Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon. Loro sono in Internet, ma non sono di Internet, sono semplicemente delle grandi organizzazioni di dati: prendono per sé una grandissima parte dell’energia data da Internet”. E ancora “in Rete è la comunità che domina sul marchio…e i big data sono la base del conglomerato verticale di cui parlavo prima. Oggi è impossibile creare un nuovo Amazon perché in moltissimi anni ha raccolto dati e ha software e capacità adatti per analizzare tutti i digital data a disposizione”.   E quando gli chiediamo se ha senso per il mercato di domini .it una campagna di marketing, Bruce Sterling afferma con sicurezza che “ad avere un dominio .it è decisamente un vantaggio e uno di questi dovrebbe essere proprio la lingua italiana. Non bisogna aver paura se la community domina il marchio: devono essere le persone e non i marchi a invadere l’Italia”. E conclude “è il made in Italy quello che conta”. Così il .it può farcela."</td><td>"2014.01.Interview.NEXA.Rete.Marketing.Web20.Torino"</td></tr>

Cory and Chris came later, but like so many more recent sci-fi authors were both influenced by the high tech low life ethos of cyberpunk. Gareth was a consumer and critic of cyberpunk fiction. This panel threw a lot of sparks, and we're happy to present this record of it."</td><td>"2014.03.SXSW.cyberpunk.panel.Kk5VMvUCw8w"</td></tr>

TBD Catalog started out as a modest effort by a workshop in Detroit, USA to discuss what was jokingly referred to as the “State of Things” and to assess the future of products, their design and associated services as society evolved with its exuberance for cultures, businesses and daily rituals in which technologies and sciences played a central, defining role.      To address this, we started by posing provocative questions to ourselves. How might the promise of what at the time was called an “internet of things” play out in the near future? What would the future look like in a world blanketed by advances in protection and surveillance technologies? If Autonomous Vehicle innovations continued its passionate race forward, what would it be to pick up the groceries, take a commercial airline flight, commute to work, have mail and parcels delivered, drop off the dry cleaning, meet friends at a bar across town, go on cross-country family vacations, or take the kids to sports practice or school?      Our design brief was to ask these questions and then represent the answers as design fictional services, evolutions of product categories and new kinds of social, domestic and retail experiences.      The result took the form of a catalog of the near future’s normal ordinary everyday. TBD Catalog is a design fiction that makes implications without making predictions. It sparks conversations about the near future. It serves to design-develop prototypes and shape embryonic concepts in order to discard them, make them better, reconsider what we may take for granted.

The celebration takes place in Barcelona in Fira Montjuïc, parallel to Sónar by Day, and brings together experts from around the world (technicians, entrepreneurs, artists, companies and researchers) to present initiatives and tools that will shape future creative experiences in the fields of music, visuals, interactive content and transmedia platforms.    Sónar+D is a meeting point with an interdisciplinary approach. It targets professionals within the creative, technological and cultural industries to pursue their interaction. The conference facilitates the exchange of knowledge, debate, exhibiting talent, and generating business opportunities. In more than two decades of existence, Sónar has made a name for itself in the discovery of emerging artists and music, giving it value as a multidisciplinary cultural event. Sónar+D extends this organic search (research) to all areas of creative industries, hence its name: I+D o R+D= Sónar+D.

Listening fans will hopefully be excited by several upcoming audio book titles in the next year being voiced by him. You can listen to his audio books that are currently available right now through Amazon, iTunes, and Audible.      Cram was most recently seen on set for the feature film WILSON opposite Woody Harrelson, and the indie film ANNIVERSARY shot in Maine, USA by movie director Jim Cole.      When not on a movie set or in a recording booth, Paul can be found deep-frying chicken wings with his sister in her kitchen, or quarreling about pop-culture with his little brother around one the 10,000 lakes of Minnesota. You can find his website Paul Cram Actor or IMDB.

About SXSW: Started in 1987, South by Southwest (SXSW) is a set of film, interactive, and music festivals and conferences that take place early each year in mid-March in Austin, Texas. SXSW's original goal was to create an event that would act as a tool for creative people and the companies they work with to develop their careers, to bring together people from a wide area to meet and share ideas. That continues to be the goal today whether it is music, film or interactive technologies.

Clarke Center for Human Imagination      DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT:      An evening with Bruce Sterling and Jasmina Tešanović, in which they will discuss two recent projects of speculative design. Jasmina Tešanović will discuss Casa Jasmina, a mix of lab, gallery space, and B&B in Turin, Italy, that aims to integrate traditional Italian skills in furniture and interior design with emergent skills in Italian open-source electronics as applied to “the internet of Things in the Home.” Bruce Sterling will discuss the upcoming installation for the Vitra Design Museum in Germany, which he and Jasmina have been in residence at the Clarke Center to incubate.       Bruce Sterling (cyberpunk visionary, futurist, and design theorist) and Jasmina Tešanović (writer, activist, and filmmaker) are in residence at the Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination collaborating with Sheldon Brown and the Clarke Center to create an installation for the Vitra Design Museum.         SPEAKER BIO:      Futurist, journalist, science-fiction author and design critic, Bruce Sterling is best known for his novels and his seminal work on the Mirrorshades anthology, which defined the cyberpunk genre. Sterling’s writings have been very influential in the cyberpunk movement in literature, specifically the novels Heavy Weather(1994), Islands in the Net (1988), Schismatrix (1985), and The Artificial Kid (1980). In 2005, he became "visionary in residence" at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. His list of accolades include the Campbell Award in 1989 for his novel Islands in the Net; the Hugo Award in 1997 and 1999 for his novelettesBicycle Repairman and Taklamakan, respectively; the Hayakawa Award in 1999 also for Taklamakan; and the Clarke Award in 2000 for his novel Distraction. Sterling also founded the Viridian Design Movement, an environmental aesthetic movement founded on the ideas of global citizenship, environmental design, and techno-progressiveness. Bruce Sterling's numerous book-length essays both question and promote how the future is shaping our concepts of self, time, and space.      Feminist and political activist (Women in Black; CodePink) Jasmina Tešanović is a writer, journalist, translator and a film director. In 1978 she promoted the first feminist conference in Eastern Europe, “Drug-ca Zena” (Belgrade). With Slavica Stojanovic, she founded the first feminist publishing house in the Balkans, “Feminist 94.″ She is the author of Diary of a Political Idiot, translated in 12 languages: a war diary written during the 1999 conflict in Kosovo. Since then she has been publishing her work on blogs and other media, always connected to the Internet."</td><td>"2016.09.DomesticRobotsHouseOfFuture.SanDiego.vyb6JgWDSvg"</td></tr>

Sie haben sich über das Internet kennengelernt, als Bruces Heimatland NATO-Bomben und Lenkflugkörper auf Jasminas Heimat regnen ließ. Der Bürgerkrieg, Kriegsherren, Auftragsmörder und Massenliquidation – es war das bittere Ende der jugoslawischen Welt.   Als besondere Gäste des WIENWOCHE Festivals und im Einklang mit dem Festivalthema  Solidarität, Freundschaft, Aktivismus und Liebe, werden Jasmina und Bruce in einigen persönlichen Bekenntnissen Einblick in ihre unorthodoxe – und reale – Liebesgeschichte gewähren. Wie führte eine ungebetene E-Mail über staatliche Auftragsmorde an Journalist_innen zu einem ruhigen häuslichen Leben, in dem zwei Feinde jeden Morgen miteinander im Bett aufwachen, sich WLAN und Kaffee teilen?   „Zuerst waren wir ‘Frenemies’, dann solidarische Kollaborateure, im Laufe der Zeit Vertraute/Freunde und schließlich Liebhaber/Ehepartner. Am Anfang war unser einzig möglicher Freiraum der utopische, virtuelle Spielplatz. In der Zwischenzeit ist aus unserer persönlichen Geschichte history/herstory geworden: aus dem Internet, unserem virtuellen Spielplatz, wurde eine Nation, die an politische Dystopie grenzt. So haben wir uns in Turin ein richtiges Zuhause erschaffen – die ‘Casa Jasmina’: das vernetzte Haus der Zukunft. Unter einer privaten Cloud, mit den Open-Source-Entwickler_innen der Weltgemeinschaft. Die künftige Art und Weise des Lebens gegen Klimawandel und für politische Geflüchtete aus der ganzen Welt.

More information available at: https://nexa.polito.it/2017/06/doctoral-course Three years ago, a unique residency was created in the city of Turin in Italy. ''Casa Jasmina'' was a joint project of the Torino Fab Lab, the Arduino open-source electronics network, and the Toolbox Co-Working design office-space. These offbeat Italian enterprises all share space in a formerly derelict FIAT factory, so they decided they needed to create a guest house that reflected their own values. That was when Bruce Sterling, science fiction novelist and former Art Center ''Visionary in Residence'', offered his alleged help. ''Casa Jasmina'' is named after Jasmina Tešanovic, Bruce's wife, and the driving force behind this project. Using open-source software and FabLab technologies such as routers, laser-cutters, 3Dprinters and Arduino control boards, Jasmina and Bruce lofted out and furnished a design-fiction house of the future that includes two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, an automated garden, a media center, many Internet-of-Things gizmos and endless torrents of espresso and prosecco. Artists, curators and astronauts showed up as guests.

It features works by artists, architects and designers who tell stories about tomorrow’s possible worlds, discussing the fears and hopes of their inhabitants. Trends of the present provide a starting point for hypothetical—and often exaggerated—scenarios. The narratives refer to technonatural environments, new types of shells for the human and other living beings, upcoming networks and infrastructures, the emergence of a data-driven society, and the redefinition of the role of the human in relation to nature and technology. The show includes video installations and architectural narratives; drafts, plans and prototypes; small-scale mock ups and models of hypothetical systems; wearables and 3D print-outs. Through different hypotheses and stories addressing the future, the show seeks to spotlight practices, methods and tools which encourage a critical engagement with changes happening already in the present.

He discusses three very different domestic spaces he has worked on in Turin with Jasmina Tesanovic:      •The Casa Jasmina in the Garrone Foundry (Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu, 1919), which was abandoned in the 1970s, and has been brought to life by FabLab Torino, Arduino and others. The Casa provides a demonstration home and family that designers can design for. Sterling notes that it has sparked critical-feminist debate about the implications of the Internet of Things.   •The apartment in Turin that Jasmina Tesanovic and he have customized in a DIY style.   •The 1653 palace of Cristina di Borbone-Francia, Aunt of Louis XIV, palace, decorated by Filippo San Martino di Agliè, whic Tesanovic and Sterling currently use as an office while they both write novels. The space was offered to them while Sterling was working on a novel about Di Agliè, which he describes as like getting a phone call from a character from one of his books. In contrast to the DIY apartment, the villa is full of antique furniture, frescoes, bizarre echoing chambers, and a private lake with an island featuring fake Roman ruins. While this “oddly friendless, almost haunted, aristocratic utopia” is the opposite of the bustling communal Foundry, they are both characteristically Turinese.      Sterling concludes by stressing the significance of architecture in his work, the built environment, Turin, the structure of cities, the intentions of things, and the flow of time. “My experience has changed my idea of what I thought I was doing.”"</td><td>"2018.09.SciARC.Masterclass.CasaJasmina.UO9twds_SUc"</td></tr>

Bruce Sterling proposes to speculate about architecture in the 2040s and the 2050s, when the students in the room will be in their 50s. He reviews his longstanding engagement with architecture, and pauses to note the recent passing of Robert Venturi, characterizing him as the rare futurist whose works continue to be a source of inspiration.      Sterling discusses current situations that suggest issues that could be significant in thirty years, including:   •China’s terraforming projects in the South China Sea, and the Belt and Road Initiative.   •Astana, Kazakhstan, which Sterling describes as neither Fatehpur Sikri nor Brasília, nor the future, but a possibility.   •Dubai as a technocratic autocracy that will not become a hegemon but an entrepôt of futurity   •Sterling discusses Estonia’s e-residency initiative as an architectural problem that that will become common in the future, requiring off-shore pop-ups promoting Virtual Estonia, physical bank/embassy registration sites, a physical headquarters within Estonia, plus the physical structures required by virtual enterprises.    •In Estonia’s capital Tallinn, Sterling discovered another architectural problem of the mid-21st century: abandoned, failed megastructures, located in sites that will probably be flodded, such as the Lenin Palace of Culture and Sports (Raine Karp and Riina Altmäe, 1980).   •Seasteading, which Sterling dismisses as impractical.   •Sterling also criticizes efforts of architects to design around the problem of climate-change flooding as “architectural solutionism”.   •Sterling considers one result of rising sea levels will be a global proliferation of unregulated squatter districts like Christiania, in Copenhagen: “wet favelas” detached from municipal services.   •He notes push-back against Silicon Valley cultural imperialism (e.g. Uber and Airbnb) in places like Barcelona and Turin, as another issue that will grow in significance.      Sterling argues that the most famous buildings of the mid-21st century will be older buildings, preserved in new ways, and retrofitted for new uses.      He dismisses artificial intelligence design as “a kaleidoscope,” providing options without insight.      He discusses Ikea’s Space10 research on autonomous food trucks, predicting that spaces will become mobile in the 21st century. He anticipates that the impact of autonomous cars will be profound: the autonomous car is regular car as the cell phone is to the landline.      Though he admits that, since Jonathan Swift’s Laputa, there has always been something ridiculous about the idea of flying cities, they might become an option if Earth’s surface becomes too polluted or dangerous.      Sterling argues that when space travel becomes feasible and cheap, the moon, planets and asteroids will be settled, but out of a sense of “cosmic Weltschmerz.”      Showing an image of the recent L.A. Forum Reader, he reminds the audience that thirty years isn’t that far off.       Sterling concludes with a discussion of some of his current projects in Turin: the Casa Jasmina, The Share Festival, and – unexpectedly – the Villa Abegg, where he works on a novel in an Eames lounge chair."</td><td>"2018.09.SciARC.SpeculativeArchitecture.-p4DV80xrm8"</td></tr>

The past is a kind of future that has already happened. The present moment vanishes before it can be described. Language, a human invention, lacks the power to fully adhere to reality.        We live in a very short now and here, since the flow of events in spacetime is mostly closed to human comprehension. But we have to say something about the future, since we have to live there. So what can we say? Being “futuristic” is a problem in metaphysics; it’s about getting language to adhere to an unknowable reality. But the futuristic quickly becomes old-fashioned, so how can the news stay news?

We are still super lucky to be able to stay safe with our friends and loved ones right now and hope you are all hanging in there.  We know it is a tough time and we appreciate you making this podcast a part of your quarantin-ing.  Basically, thank you for not socially-distancing yourselves from this podcast.  We are continuing our sequence on science fiction during the COVID-19 crisis.  This week, Colin and Henry welcome Bruce Sterling, author, futurist, and one of the founders of Cyberpunk movement along with his partner Jasmina Tešanović, Serbian activist, author, feminist, and filmmaker.  Sterling and Tešanović offer their perspective on what is going on in Belgrade, Serbia (where they are currently under a rigid lockdown) that perhaps can shed light on the pandemic.  Sterling brings (slightly terrifying) insight on speculative world-building in response to our current reality.  Sterling, well known for developing the concept of “design fiction,” discusses how companies and political organizations engage with world-building to anticipate problems and social change. Sterling dives deep into the potential policy changes that may happen, such as the rise of surveillance and technology companies becoming the new power brokers.  He describes how the current world order emerged post-9/11 as policy decisions reacted to perceived and anticipated threats and suggests that the pandemic is apt to bring new shifts in power.  Sterling provocatively suggests that when the pandemic ends, we may be living with its consequences but we will forget, as other generations have, the health threat itself.  Sterling discusses the role of Chinese soft power, specifically in the Balkan region, and suggests that China is gaining global influence even as the American Belle Epoque is ending.  Most surprisingly, Sterling dismantles the Cyberpunk ethos he helped create (mind blown right?) as science fiction writers are playing a different role in response to the changed environment in which they are working.  A silver lining Sterling does provide is an enthusiasm over Twitter (who would have thought?)!  Listen in as Sterling discusses a progression of pulp writers to contemporary ones like Cory Doctorow!  The list of those writers will be in the notes section, if you’re looking to expand your pandemic reading list.

Bruce Sterling now introduces us to his alter ego: Bruno Argento, the preeminent author of fantascienza. Sterling, writing as Argento, skillfully combines cutting-edge technology with art, mythology, and history.        ''It's as if Sterling is the only writer paying attention.''-Locus        In the Esoteric City, a Turinese businessman's act of necromancy is catching up with him. The Black Swan, a rogue hacker, programs his way into alternate versions of Italy. A Parthenopean assassin awaits his destiny in the arms of a two-headed noblewoman. Infuriating to both artists and scientists, a robot wheelchair makes uncategorizable creations.        Bruno Argento is the acknowledged master of Italian science fiction. Yet that same popular fantascienza author also is known in America-as Bruce Sterling. In Robot Artists and Black Swans, we present the first collection of their uniquely visionary Italian-themed fiction, including tales never before published in English.        ABOUT BRUCE STERLING    Bruce Sterling (Schismatrix, The Zenith Angle, Zeitgeist) is an internationally bestselling author, journalist, editor, columnist, and critic.
